# Bakery Text

A CUI-based bakery game. Use commands to bake bread while managing economic factors and fending off intruders.

## Gameplay

Manage multiple terminals, balance supply and demand, and protect your bakery from unwanted guests.
Aim for a high score by maintaining steady sales and efficient operations.

### Key Features:
- **Economic Simulation**: Prices and demand fluctuate based on the **"NIGIWAI" (Economic Tempo) ⭐️0.0~5.0**.
- **Inventory Management**: Maintain an optimal stock of bread while preventing shortages.
- **Tower Defense Mechanics**: Chase away intruders (`shoo` command) to prevent economic losses.

## Game Elements

- Terminals have **Commander** and **Observer** modes.
- In **Observer mode**, information flows continuously. Switch to **Commander mode** to input commands.
- Ingredients and artifacts are unique to each terminal. Use the `mv` command to transfer them.
- **NIGIWAI**: A 5-star rating system that affects demand and pricing:
  - ⭐️ 5.0: High demand, high prices, but expensive ingredients.
  - ⭐️ 0.0: Low demand, low prices, but cheap ingredients.
  - Demand drops if customers repeatedly find empty shelves.

## General Commands

- `help`: Display available commands for the current section.
- `ls`: Observe the current state.
- `mv`: Move ingredients or artifacts to another terminal.
- `shoo`: Chase away intruders.

### Enum Mapping

The `ID` column corresponds to the `TerminalSection` enum in the code:

```typescript
enum TerminalSection {
	Purchasing = 0,
	Pantry,
	Mixing,
	Cooling,
	Shaping,
	Baking,
	Packaging,
	QualityControl,
	Storage,
	SalesFront,
	Waste,
	Utilities,
}
```

## Intruders (Unwanted Guests)

Intruders frequently enter different sections and disrupt operations.
If left unchecked, they cause financial loss and product waste, reducing stock and leading to **missed sales opportunities**.

| Type      | Behavior |
|----------|----------|
| **Nezumi (Rats)** 🐭 | Nibble on bread, reducing available stock. |
| **Dorobō (Thieves)** 🏴‍☠️ | Steal money directly from the register. |
| **Kureimā (Complainers)** 😡 | Continuously demand refunds, reducing demand tempo. |

### **How to Handle Intruders**
- Use the `shoo` command in **Commander mode** to chase them away.
- Ignoring intruders results in **economic losses and product spoilage**.
- **Bonus:** Successfully shooing intruders can **increase customer trust**, boosting demand.
