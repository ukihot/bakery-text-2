# Bakery Text

A CUI-based bakery management game focused on inventory control, maintenance, security, hygiene, and cost optimisation.

## General Commands

- `help` : Display available commands for the current section.
- `ls`   : Observe the current state.
- `rest` : Allow employees to rest and recover from fatigue.

## NIGIWAI

- A 5-star rating system that affects demand and pricing:
  - ⭐️ 5.0: High demand, high prices, but expensive ingredients.
  - ⭐️ 0.0: Low demand, low prices, but cheap ingredients.
- NIGIWAI is influenced by:
  - ✅ Proper inventory & waste management
  - ✅ Effective intruder control & cleanliness
  - ✅ Stable production & high sales
  - ❌ Overcrowding, high waste rates
  - ❌ Persistent intruder presence (rats, thieves)
  - ❌ Customer complaints or refunds

## Troubles by Department

- **PS (Purchasing)**: Price surges, fraud, delivery delays (transport issues, bad weather)
- **PN (Pantry)**: Spoilage, pest intrusion
- **MX/CL/SH/BK (Mixing, Cooling, Shaping, Baking)**: Equipment failure, workplace accidents
- **BK (Baking)**: Temperature anomalies, gas leaks
- **PK (Packaging)**: Foreign object contamination
- **SF (Sales Front)**: Complainer incidents, robbery
- **WS (Waste Station)**: Overloaded waste
- **UT (Utilities)**: Water leaks, electrical leaks

## Fatigue Management

- Employees do not show numerical fatigue levels. Instead, their status is displayed in logs:
  - 😊 “Looking energetic.”
  - 😐 “Seems a bit tired.”
  - 😫 “Moving slower than usual.”
  - 💀 “Eyes look lifeless…”
- Use `rest` to prevent overwork. However, excessive resting will reduce efficiency and impact the score.

## Intruders & Security

Intruders cause economic losses and hygiene risks. Monitor their presence via the **Event Log (EV)** and respond promptly.

| Type                          | Behaviour                                            | Counteraction                                              |
| ----------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Nezumi (Rats)** 🐭         | Consume stock, increase hygiene risk.              | `trap` (set traps), `sanitize` (clean infected areas)       |
| **Dorobō (Thieves)** 🏴‍☠️    | Steal money from the register.                     | `guard` (increase security), `alarm` (set up anti-theft system) |
| **Kureimā (Complainers)** 😡  | Demand refunds, lowering NIGIWAI.                  | `compensate` (settle issue), `policy` (set refund rules)     |

## Game Over Conditions

1. **Overwork**
   Employees collapsing due to excessive fatigue → **Game Over**.

2. **Health Department Violation**
   Failing to maintain hygiene (e.g., rats present too long) triggers an inspection → **Game Over**.
